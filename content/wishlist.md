Thank you for finding your way to my wishlist ❤️ The fact you're even here and considering getting me something means a lot to me.

I fully acknowledge I'm a nightmare to buy for, and anything I really need I will usually get for myself. Instead of habitually impulse purchasing things, I've been trying to add things to the lists below instead.

Some of the things on here are pretty expensive and I wouldn't expect them from one person, feel free to club together with someone else!

Lots of love
Elliot
