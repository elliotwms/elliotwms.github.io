Hi! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Elliot, I'm born and raised in sunny South Wales, and I've spent most of my adult life training and working as a backend software engineer. I'm currently mainly working in Go.  

I work remotely from a home in Carmarthenshire I share with my partner, our two cats (Martin and Kestrel) and a leopard gecko named Onion.

My hobbies include computer games, boardgames, good food, great TV and modular synthesis (currently for my ears only - consider yourself spared).

I'm also an occasional [speaker](/talks) and fair-weather [open-source contributor and tinkerer](/projects).
