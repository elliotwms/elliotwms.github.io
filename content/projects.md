You can get a glimpse of what I'm working on in my free time over on [GitHub](https://github.com/elliotwms). Here are some hand-picked recent(ish) ones:

### [fakediscord](https://github.com/elliotwms/fakediscord)

A drop-in replacement for the Discord API, to facilitate the testing of Discord bots. Still heavily in development and in the earliest of stages, I started working on this to help me write my own bots and get around some of the limitations with using a real API to test your services.

More info in [the readme for project itself](https://github.com/elliotwms/fakediscord)

### [Pinbot](https://github.com/elliotwms/pinbot)

A Discord bot to circumnavigate Discord's 50-pin-per-channel limit and add some small extra features.
